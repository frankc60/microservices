# microservices
written in nodejs. microservices uses slack-node-sdk to connect to a bot.
as well as using natural language processor - Wit.ai

## What I learnt
* Slack usability
* Slack's SDK
* Wit.ai - natural language processor
* Building and designing a microservice that interfaces with Slack and Wit.ai
