# microservices
written in nodejs. microservices uses slack-node-sdk to connect to a bot.
as well as using natural language processor - Wit.ai

## What I learnt
* Slack usability
* Slack's SDK
* Wit.ai - natural language processor: intents, confidence
* Allowing Slack messages to be understood and processed in NodeJs
* Building and designing a microservice that interfaces with Slack and Wit.ai in realtime

### more
1. node /bin/run.js
2. open Slack, log in
3. check bot: franko
4. ask him "what is the time in Auckland?"
    "see you later"
    "do you like beer"
